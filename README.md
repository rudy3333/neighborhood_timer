# Neighborhood Timer

Neighborhood Timer is a desktop application built with Kivy for logging and tracking project time, designed to integrate with the Hack Club's Adventure Time API and Hackatime. It allows users to authenticate via email OTP, select apps and projects, and log their work time.


## Installation

### Running the app

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```


## API

This app interacts with the [Adventure Time API](https://adventure-time.hackclub.dev/api) for authentication, app/project data, and time logging. You will need a valid Hack Club account to use the app.

## Notes
Your API keys and tokens are stored locally in plain text files for convenience. Do not share these files.
